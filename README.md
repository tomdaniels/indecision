# Indecision

A web-app to help make those tricky decision, and to learn React

## Local Development
The app uses Babel to compile the React@16.0.0 code, to set this automatically you can run: 
```bash
 babel src/app.js --out-file=public/scripts/app.js --presets=env,react --watch
```

To throw the Babel compile code onto your browser just start the program with:
```bash
live-server public
```
